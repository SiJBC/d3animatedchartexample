# d3animatedchartexample

An example of using d3 transition methods to update data with animations.

The d3 library comes with inbuilt transitions. The transitions are added by utilising the three functions which d3 uses to adjust data visualisations.

The enter method when data is entered to a page

The update method when data is updated 

The exit method for when data is removed from the page.
